Building a basic MVC app with Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web

![MVC](https://juanlucodingbinding.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/mvc.jpg)

## Built With 🛠️

This code is written in C#, HTML and ASP.NET with Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web.
Of course you can use your prefer framework or IDE.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started 🚀

This project contains three main folders:

1. **Model** - Model folder

   - I've defined the Car class, file [coche.cs] into Models folder

2. **View** - View folder

   - In the [Index.cshtml] file I'm using Razor to render the data in html

3. **Controller** - Controller folder

   - In the file [HomeController.cs] I've defined a Car List with 4 instances of cars

4. **.gitignore** – git ignore files

   - refs to the files ignored by git

### Prerequisites 📋

- You can work with your prefer IDE.

### Installation 🔧

- You don't need to install anything because this is a simple MVC example. You can see a detailed description on my spanish blog https://juanlucodingbinding.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/modelo-mvc-ejemplo-basico-de-mvc-en-asp-net-mvc-4/
